            Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
            liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any
            provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the

          </p>
          <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall
            the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
            indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other

            any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and
            even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
            which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
            these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
            extent permitted by law.
          </p>
          <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>
            The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with

            extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own
            behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
            licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties,
            whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to

            performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
            foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and
            makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your

          <p>
            Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
            company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
            express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
            Service, or the information, content, and materials or products
            included thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or
            error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of
            any information or content provided through the Service; or (iv)
            that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or

          </p>
          <p>
            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.
